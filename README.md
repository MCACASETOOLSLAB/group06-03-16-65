The problem:

Santa Claus sleeps at the North pole until awakened by either all
of the nine reindeer, or by a group of three out of ten elves. He
performs one of two indivisible actions:

   ≤ If awakened by the group of reindeer, Santa harnesses them to
a sleigh, delivers toys, and finally unharnesses the reindeer who
then go on vacation.

   ≤ If awakened by a group of elves, Santa shows them into his
office, consults with them on toy R&D, and finally shows them
out so they can return to work constructing toys.

   A waiting group of reindeer must be served by Santa before a waiting
group of elves. Since Santa’s time is extremely valuable, marshalling
the reindeer or elves into a group must not be done by Santa
