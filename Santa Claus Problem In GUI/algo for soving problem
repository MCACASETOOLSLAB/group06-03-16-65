                      
                      ALGORITHM
                
  We now give an outline of the solution using semaphores, omitting the details of the calculations of the global variables and the semaphores protecting them.
There is a single Santa process which waits on the semaphoreSanta; it will be awakened by the ninth reindeer or the third elf. If awakened by the last
reindeer, Santa executes as follows: awaken the eight other reindeer, harness all nine reindeer to the sleigh, deliver the toys and unharness the reindeer. The
algorithm for the elves is similar.


loop
 P(Santa);
 if All_Reindeer_Ready then
  for All_Waiting_Reindeer loop
   V(Reindeer_Wait);
   end loop;
 for All_Reindeer loop
 V(Harness);
 end loop;
 Deliver_Toys;
 for All_Reindeer loop
 V(Unharness);
 end loop;
 else -- All_Elves_Ready
 for All_Waiting_Elves loop
 V(Elf_Wait);
 end loop;
 for All_Elves loop
 V(Invite_In);
 end loop;
 Consult;
 for All_Elves loop
 V(Show_Out);
 end loop;
 end if;
end loop;



Turning to the reindeer processes, the first eight reindeer returning from vacation are blocked on the semaphore
Reindeer_Wait; the ninth reindeer wakes Santa who proceeds to awaken the other eight blocked reindeer. The elf 
processes are similar.


loop
  if Is_Last_Reindeer then
  V(Santa);
  else
  P(Reindeer_Wait);
  end if;
  P(Harness);
  Deliver_Toys;
  P(Unharness);
end loop;


The problem with this solution is the assumption that once the reindeer have been released from waiting on Reindeer_Wait, they will be harnessed and
deliver toys together with Santa. But nothing prevents a malicious scheduler from scheduling Santa, who now proceeds 
to harness the reindeer, deliver the toys himself, and unharness the reindeer, before the reindeer have executed
Deliver_Toys or even P(Harness) ! Recall that V operations never block; a V operation on a strong semaphore will
release blocked processes, but such ready processes do not necessarily run. In fact, a truly miserly scheduler could now
have Santa retire and consult indefinitely, to the consternation of the reindeer freezing in the stable.
