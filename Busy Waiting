<p>BUSY-WAITING:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>As long as a process is denied access to its critical section,
it will   stay in a tight loop and wait until it can proceed, 
all the while   wasting processor time.  This continuous testing of the lock variable is   called <strong> busy waiting</strong>.</p>


<p> Here, in this problem when there are 3 elves present with the santa seeking for his help for constructing toys....the fourth elf has to wait untill all the 3 elf are served by the santa, till that time the fourth elf stays in a tight loop and wait for santa to be free.This continuous waiting of the elf is said to be <strong>busy waitng</strong>. </p>
